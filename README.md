# Drink is Gold
Exercise about a vending machine in JS during my training at Interface3 â€“ Brussels

This is a simple vending machine simulation created with HTML and JavaScript. The program displays a selection of beverages, their stock levels, and their corresponding numbers. Users can select a beverage by entering its number. When a beverage is selected, the image of the chosen beverage appears in the vending machine's collection tray, and the stock level decreases accordingly.
